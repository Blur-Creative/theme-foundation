## Shopware 5 Theme Foundation

Is an alternative to Shopware's Responsive Theme to develope your own Theme or Plugin Template.
It **isn't a wohle Theme**. It's **more of a solid Theme Base**.
It uses the same style classes so you can follow the Responsive Theme Style Guide.

## What's next?

In this Branch we Merge the Bare and the Responsive Theme into the Foundation Theme.  
So there are no requirements anymore to use the Foundation Theme.  

**Why we are doing this?**  
First of all that improves the Performance in the Backend and the compilation Time because there is no dependence of Bare / Responsive anymore.
Second we can improve some jQuery Codes directly so we don't need to override them.  
This should lower the overall Javascript filesize.  

The Goal is to develope a super lightweight Base Theme which you can use to build your own awesome Theme without disadvantages.  

The Development starts with Shopware 5.5.3 and we will Update all original components of the Bare and Responsive Theme constantly.
