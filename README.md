## Shopware 5 Theme Foundation 

Is an alternative to Shopware's Responsive Theme to develope your own Theme or Plugin Template.
It **isn't a wohle Theme**. It's **more of a solid Theme Base**.
It uses the same style classes so you can follow the Responsive Theme Style Guide.

### What are the advantages? Just take a look:
- Rejects the Responsive Theme CSS and build a far better LESS Coding Base
- Super lightweight and clean LESS Code (half of the Responsive Theme outputted  CSS Size)
- Useful Bootstrap 4 Components are added (You can add the whole BS4 Framework but beware of conflicts with the Responsive Theme Style Guide)
- Some disadvantageous coded JS Plugins were fixed
    - Dropdown Menu
- more to come

### Requirements
- Minimum Shopware 5.4.x
- Bare and Responsive Theme

### Conclusion

Still in development (pre alpha) but it's growing fast.
